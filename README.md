âœ” Fee and Deadline Information: Retrieves updated fee structures, payment modes, and application deadlines instantly.
âœ” Multilingual Support: Can communicate in multiple regional and international languages for better reach.

Technologies Used:
âœ” IBM Cloud Lite Services
âœ” Natural Language Processing (NLP)
âœ”Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
âœ” IBM Granite Model
âœ” IBM Cloud Watsonx ai studio
âœ” IBM Cloud Watsonx ai Runtime
âœ” IBM Cloud Agent Lab
